program. Our bot is built with a heuristics based <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>state machine</a>. Each state has a hard
coded weight that will give precedence to an action that can be taken that
moment. Dota is an incredibly complex game and it is nearly impossible to tell
if a change to a weight is beneficial or if the bot just got lucky one game. We
need a way to run hundreds of games and get hard data on if the change was
beneficial.</p><h1 id=distributed-dota-as-a-service>Distributed Dota as a service</h1><p>We need to run a Dota executable multiple times with different bot files to
determine which set of weights were the most effective in practice. Docker is
the obvious choice. Docker lets us automatically load the game, the bot files,
and return the output. Setting up a docker container that grabs the Dota and
bot files from the local disk is simple. After some googling and testing we
have a way to run a game of Dota and pipe the output to a file.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Docker data-lang=Docker><span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>FROM</span><span style=color:#666;font-style:italic> fedora:latest</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><h2 id=parsing-game-logs>Parsing Game Logs</h2><p>Of course Dota couldn&rsquo;t provide nice json files as logs so let&rsquo;s get to
parsing. Dota game logs vary in length but are consistent with spacing and
formatting. For example, if a tower dies the log will always read: ~Building:
npc_Dota_3_tower destroyed~. Man if only there were a way to use regular
expressions to match lines and grab fields from those lines.</p><h2 id=awk>AWK</h2><p>Awk is a specific purpose programming language (like wolfram alpha or bison)
as opposed to a general purpose programming language (like Lisp or Prolog).
This means that awk does one thing, and one thing well; text stream processing.
Using GNU Awk we can easily write statement that will write the time a tower
dies. Using this as the basis, it is a non issue to implement every other
action that can happen throughout the game.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Awk data-lang=Awk><span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>if</span>($0 ~ <span style=color:#666;font-style:italic>/Building: npc_Dota_.*_(tower|rax)/</span>){
    <span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>printf</span> <span style=color:#666;font-style:italic>&#34;tower %s died at %d&#34;</span>, $2, <span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>systime</span>()
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id=distributed-dota>Distributed Dota</h2><p>We can run multiple games and pipe the nicely formatted output to files. Now we
would like to run hundreds of games and use the data from them to create pretty
graphs representing how well our bot does. Each docker container runs one game
of Dota, uses two cores, and about 1.3 gigs of ram. Since our computers have 8
threads and 8 gigs of ram we can optimally run 4 games at a time. What we would
like to do is tell the server to run 100 games and have each computer run up to
4 games in parallel until that 100 game quota is met.</p><h2 id=coroutines-are-cool>Coroutines Are Cool</h2><p>We will build our own custom solution in a programming language made for
distributed computing. Our general layout will work like this.</p><h3 id=server>Server</h3><p>The server is informed that 100 games are to be played. The server
then starts each worker and opens a http server to listen for
requests from each worker. It listens for a START request and
replies yes or no depending on if there are still games to be run
or not. If it receives a json file instead of a start request it
will log it and increment the number of games ran. The server is
just smart enough to worry about how many games it is running and
how many games it needs to run, nothing else. Load balancing is
handled by the worker.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Go data-lang=Go><span style=color:#888;font-style:italic>// start http server

        log.<span style=color:#666;font-weight:700;font-style:italic>Print</span>(err)
    }
}

<span style=color:#888;font-style:italic>// wait for every worker to complete their games
</span><span style=color:#888;font-style:italic></span>finished.<span style=color:#666;font-weight:700;font-style:italic>Wait</span>()
</code></pre></div><p><code>finished</code> is a wait group meaning that finished.Wait() will block until every
worker has sent back it&rsquo;s json data. We have a wait group so that our server
will not end before the workers have all sent back their game data.</p><h3 id=worker>Worker</h3><p>The worker is in charge of load balancing it&rsquo;s computer and running games.
When the server is woke it sends ~MAX_GAMES~ requests to the server, asking to
start games. In Go this is easy:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Go data-lang=Go>limit := limiter.<span style=color:#666;font-weight:700;font-style:italic>NewConcurrencyLimiter</span>(MAX_GAMES)
done := <span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>false</span>
<span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>for</span> !done {
	done = limit.<span style=color:#666;font-weight:700;font-style:italic>Execute</span>(RunGame)
	time.<span style=color:#666;font-weight:700;font-style:italic>Sleep</span>(time.Second * 3) <span style=color:#888;font-style:italic>// because other computers are slow
</span><span style=color:#888;font-style:italic></span>}
limit.<span style=color:#666;font-weight:700;font-style:italic>Wait</span>()
</code></pre></div><p><code>RunGame</code> sends a http request to the server and runs a game based on the
response. Since running a docker container/Dota game, blocks until it has
finished running we need to spawn a new process every time we start a game.
Again, in Go this is easy.</p><p>Now that we have our server and workers communicating nicely we can run lots of
games and generate huge amounts of data.</p><h1 id=machine-learning>Machine Learning</h1><p>As fun as tweaking random bot variables is, it&rsquo;s not very efficient.. for
humans. Luckily computers can do boring tasks very fast. Since we have a lack
of time and processing power we will use an algorithm that takes less of both.</p><h2 id=genetic-algorithms>Genetic Algorithms</h2><p>Genetic algorithms are a type of machine learning based on random mutations and
survival of the fittest. Instead of running the server once and getting a
result back, we want that result to be fed back into next round&rsquo;s bots. The new
server will work as follows:</p><p><img src=/img/genetic-uml.png alt=/static/img/genetic-uml.png></p><p>For my sake, I&rsquo;m not explaining the nitty gritty of how genes are selected but
if you want to learn more about genetic algorithms Wikipedia has a good article
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm>here</a>. Genetic algorithms are
just a small taste of machine learning and are still incredibly complicated.</p><p>Implementing a genetic algorithm is only as hard as running the server over and
over and processing data. In order to process each games data we need to write
a function that will go over the logs and generate a fitness score for each
hero. A fitness score is a cumulative score of how well the bot did with the
new mutated genes. An example fitness function would look something like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=font-weight:700;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline>func</span> <span style=color:#666;font-weight:700;font-style:italic>CalculateFitness</span>(hero *heroEvaluation) <span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>float64</span> {
	fitness := 0.0

	fitness += hero.winrate * WIN_MOD
	fitness += hero.killsPerMinute * KPM_MOD
	fitness += hero.assistsPerMinute * APM_MOD
	fitness += hero.goldPerMinute * GPM_MOD
	fitness += hero.deathsPerMinute * DPM_MOD
	fitness += hero.experiencePerMinute * XPM_MOD

	<span style=font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline>return</span> fitness
}
</code></pre></div><p>Each score would then be added together and given a percentage to be
incorporated into the gene pool.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go>chance := (heroFitness = totalFitness)
</code></pre></div><p>And voila, you taught a computer to reproduce. Go have some cake, you
deserve it bud.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>Writing a Dota bot is not fun. Designing and implementing a distributed,
machine learning powered Dota swarm is. The complexity and variance in each
little problem means that we were able to help each other solve things we may
not have learned in a one dimensional project. From docker, to machine
learning, to shell scripting and network administration. I learned a lot about
programming and, more importantly, project design and problem solving.</p></div></article></main></div></body></html>
