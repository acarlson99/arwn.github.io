    <h2>General Advice</h2>
    <p>Want a list of everything that doesn't kill you as
    fast? <a href="http://www.whfoods.org/foodstoc.php">http://www.whfoods.org/foodstoc.php</a>. Carbs
    are ok in moderation. Fat is good for you. Eat whole foods. Sugar
    makes you depressed. Gluten might too. Do not try to lose weight,
    try to be healthy. Give pickling a try, it's really easy and makes
    all those bland veggies much better.</p>
    
    <p>The assholes at Walmart will do anything they can to make you
    think that their sugary cancer 'food' is healthy.  The good news
    is all you have to do is look at the back of the box and see
    what's in it. As your grandma would say <b>"If you can't pronounce
    it, don't buy it"</b>.  A few notable things to look out for are:
    sugar and
    it's <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-spot-and-avoid-added-sugar">
    many names</a>, vegetable oils, processed food of any kind,
    processed meat, preservatives, soda (yes diet soda kills you),
    juice, anything fried, margarine, bottled water, deli meat, bread,
    rice.</p>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Meal Prep</h2>
    <p>You will get tired of eating the same thing after a day or
    two. A better idea is to prep individual ingredients.  Are you
    making beef and broccoli, make some extra beef to add to salads,
    omlettes, or other dishes throughout the week. Are you making some
    tacos?  make a big batch of salsa for the week and reuse that beef
    you already have cooked. You get the idea, just don't go
    crazy. Stick prepping one or two things you know you will eat.</p>
    Here are some good foods to prep.
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken (really any meat). Just cook and shred it. Goes in
      tacos, stir fry, salad, sandwich, etc.</li>
      <li>Pickles. Pickles last forever. Onions, cucumbers, and
      peppers are my favorite</li>
      <li>Salad dressing. Making dressing is time consuming and it
      goes bad pretty fast but a home made caesar is so much better
      than the shelf brand shit.</li>
      <li>Marinated meat. You really only need to marinade your meat
      for an hour but overnight doesn't hurt. Simple is better.</li>
    </ul>
