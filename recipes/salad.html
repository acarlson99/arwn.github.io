    <h1>Salad</h1>
    <p>Put green things in bowl, add sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Veggie base: cabbage, brussel sprouts, spring mix, bean
        sprouts, broccoli, romaine lettuce, spinach, kayle</li>
      <li>Protein: salmon, chicken, (boiled) egg, tofu, tempeh (no
        one likes tempeh)</li>
      <li>Toppings: onion, avocado, raw nuts and seeds (pumpkin,
        chia, walnut, etc..), cheese, carrot, cucumber, beans in
        moderation, tomato, olive, fruit</li>
      <li>Dressing: anything by Primal Kitchen, oil and vinegar,
        Goddess, or nothing if you are a punk.</li>
      <li>Banned: basically every salad dressing ever, deli meat,
        iceberg, corn, cranberries, dried fruit, peas, crutons,
        crunchy noodles, tortilla, pasta (you get the idea)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>note: Most dressing is very dangerous, make sure to read
      the label. The man wants you to think ranch is healthy.
      <br />note: Bacon and tuna can probably be eaten a few times a
      month.</p>
