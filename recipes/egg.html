    <h1>Egg</h1>
    <p>When choosing eggs you don't want to buy the 89Â¢ clearance
      eggs. Stick with organic eggs. Chickens that spend little to no
      time outdoors may have lables such as "Free Range", "Pasture
      Raised", and "Cage Free". If possible, try to source local eggs
      from farms that promote a natural chicken lifestyle.</p>
